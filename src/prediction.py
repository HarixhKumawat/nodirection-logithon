Air freight is faster but can be affected by weather disruptions.\n* *Specific route:*  The specific ports within India and Singapore used can influence the on-time rate due to potential congestion or customs delays.\n* *Type of cargo:*  Certain goods may require specialized handling or documentation, impacting delivery times. \n* *Current events:*  Geopolitical situations, weather events, or infrastructure disruptions can affect both success and on-time rates.\n\n*Additional Considerations:\n\n *Delivery timeframes:*  While the on-time rate is high, delivery times can still vary significantly depending on the chosen mode of transport. Sea freight may take several weeks, while air freight can take a few days.\n* *Customs clearance:* Efficient customs clearance processes in both India and Singapore contribute to the high success rate. However, delays can occur due to documentation issues or inspections."]
